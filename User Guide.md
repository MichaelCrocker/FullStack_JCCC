## Account Registration
Anyone can view Paws in Motions' available walkers, but once you are ready to

page can be reached from the "Register" button on the homepage or the "Signup"
option under the Account dropdown menu. To complete registration, just fill out
the form with the requested information and click register at the bottom of the
page.

## User Login
Once you have an account, you can log in at any time to book a walk for your 
dog(s). The login page can be reached from the "Signin" option under the
Account dropdown menu - from there you can enter the email and password
associated with your account to log in.

## Dog Registration
Once you have created your account, you will need to add your dog(s) to your
profile before you can book a walk for them. To register a new dog to your
account, you will need to fill out the form found at the "Register New Dog"
link at the top of each page.

Once there you can select your start and end times and hit submit.
